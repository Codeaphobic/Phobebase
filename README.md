# The Phobebase

Repository of all codeaphobics base classes and useful functions to help reduce development time.

Some of the systems within the codebase come from projects made by the codeaphobic teams so they might not be intuitive to use, but we will try our best to comment code to help with understanding its function and purpose.

Main branch - Should work with no Unity errors
Indev branch - Might be missing meta files and have half intregrated classes with errors in unity
